Create a working PoC for the following vulnerability.

# CVE: {{ cve_id }}

## Vulnerability Analysis

{{ vulnerability_analysis }}

## Patch Diff (Reference)

The patch shows what was fixed. Use this to understand the vulnerable code path:

```diff
{{ patch_diff }}
```

## Testing Environment

- **Chrome Path**: {{ chrome_path }}
- **Recommended Flags**: `--no-sandbox --disable-gpu --js-flags="--expose-gc --allow-natives-syntax"`

## Development Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze
Based on the vulnerability analysis above:
1. Identify the exact JavaScript/HTML construct needed
2. Understand what object state triggers the bug
3. Determine if JIT optimization is required

### Step 2: Create Initial PoC
Use `create_poc_file` to create your first attempt:
- Start minimal
- Add comments explaining each step
- Include necessary setup code

### Step 3: Test
Use `run_chrome_with_poc` to test:
- Check for crashes
- Look for ASAN errors if using ASAN build
- Check console output for errors

### Step 4: Iterate
Based on test results:
- **No crash**: Adjust timing, add more setup, change values
- **Wrong crash location**: Modify to hit correct code path
- **Success**: Document and simplify

### Step 5: Finalize
Once working:
- Remove unnecessary code
- Add clear comments
- Verify reproducibility with `test_poc_reproducibility`

## Success Criteria

A successful PoC should:
1. Trigger a crash or observable security violation
2. Crash at or near the patched location
3. Be reproducible (not flaky)
4. Be documented with clear explanation

Begin development now. Create your initial PoC based on the vulnerability analysis.
