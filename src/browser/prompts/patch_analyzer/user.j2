# Analysis Instructions

1. **Read the patch carefully**: Identify all modified files, functions, and the exact changes made.

2. **Understand the vulnerable code path**:
   - What was the code doing before the fix?
   - What incorrect assumption or missing check existed?

3. **Identify the fix**:
   - What check/validation was added?
   - What logic was corrected?

4. **Determine how to trigger**:
   - What JavaScript/HTML constructs reach this code?
   - What sequence of operations triggers the bug?
   - What object types or values are needed?

5. **Develop PoC strategy**:
   - What's the minimum code to trigger?
   - How do we verify the vulnerability is triggered?
   - What observable behavior indicates success?

## Important Considerations

- Focus on the REMOVED or MODIFIED lines - they show the vulnerable behavior
- Pay attention to type checks, null checks, bounds checks
- Consider race conditions if timing-related changes are present
- For V8 bugs, think about JIT optimization and deoptimization
- For Blink bugs, think about DOM lifecycle and memory management
